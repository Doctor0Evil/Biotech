//! Biophysical aura + karma-governed decay/evolve modulation.
//!
//! This module plugs into the existing lifeforce-guarded inner-ledger path
//! (`apply_lifeforce_guarded_adjustment` + `InnerLedger::system_apply`) and
//! provides a *non-financial*, per-host, per-domain multiplier that:
//! - Rewards sustained decay reduction / eco-healthy behavior.
//! - Caps per-day EVOLVE for sensitive “teeth-claws” defensive mutations.
//! - Never bypasses lifeforce, eco, SCALE, or consent invariants.
//!
//! It is intentionally narrow: it only shapes *how much* mutation from a
//! given `SystemAdjustment` may be realized, never *who* owns anything.
