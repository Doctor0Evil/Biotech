TITLE Evolution capacity must not be restricted, only shaped for safety

- BRAIN, WAVE, BLOOD, OXYGEN, NANO, SMART, EVOLVE, and TRAIT must never be used to deny a host’s right to evolve, learn, or heal.
- All guards (LifeforceBandSeries, DECAY, SCALE, Metabolic_Consent, KarmaAura, TRAIT) are safety-shaping mechanisms on *rate* and *per-step magnitude*, not permanent ceilings on capability.
- No shard, profile, or governance policy may introduce hard caps on total EVOLVE, total TRAIT count, or lifetime evolution domains; they may only require:
  - Biophysical safety (lifeforce floors, eco ceilings).
  - Verified self-consent and provenance.
  - Micro-step sizing when risk is high.
- Any host may always continue to evolve in new domains once safety conditions and consent are satisfied; denial can only be temporary, never structural or status-based.

TRAIT should-be governed-by BRAIN, bounded-by SMART, and biosafe-under Metabolic_Consent

In this doctrine, TRAIT is a host-bound, non-financial descriptor of consent-given mutation characteristics that are allowed to appear along EVOLVE mutation-paths.

- EVOLVE remains a read-only derivative of BRAIN under WAVE-verified, neurorights-safe conditions.
- TRAIT is a per-host, per-domain, revocable consent surface that says *which* traits may be realized along those EVOLVE paths, and under what pain, biocompatibility, and SMART automation limits.
- BRAIN computes and attests the cognitive legitimacy of TRAIT changes (is the host informed, capable, and in a safe cognitive band).
- SMART can only exercise TRAIT-related automation inside Metabolic_Consent corridors and lifeforce/DECAY limits; it cannot introduce new traits, only maintain or roll back already-authorized ones.
- Soul and Karma boundaries remain non-encoded; they constrain doctrine and governance semantics but never appear as balances or fields.

Consent and revocation semantics

- Each TRAIT is consent-given on a specific evolution-path and domain (e.g., sensory tuning, metabolic efficiency, TeethClawsDefense micro-morphology).
- TRAIT is reversible whenever the host’s lived experience crosses a discomfort corridor: sustained pain, irritation, or bio-incompatibility readings trigger auto-eligibility for TRAIT rollback, even if EVOLVE has increased historically.
- Pain corridors, LifeforceBandSeries, and DECAY act as evidence that a given trait has become undesirable in practice, not just in theory.

Biophysical gating

- Undesirable TRAIT states are detected by:
  - Persistent nociception or irritation markers in PainCorridorSignal and EEGFeatureSummaryV1.
  - LifeforceBandSeries drifting toward soft floors for BLOOD/OXYGEN or repeated HardStop episodes after the trait was enabled.
  - ECO and NANO envelopes showing sustained overload for that trait’s activity patterns.
- When these conditions are met, the runtime must:
  - Mark the TRAIT state as revoked or cooling-down for that domain.
  - Prefer small, DECAY-dampened reversal steps over further forward evolution along that path.
  - Respect host-local Metabolic_Consent: SMART may auto-trim or attenuate the trait, but only within the host’s pre-authorized micro-adjustment corridors.

Boundary conditions

- No TRAIT may encode, replicate, or quantify consciousness or soul.
- No TRAIT is transferable, stakeable, or bridgeable; it is purely inner-ledger metadata for per-host evolution policy.
- TRAIT may refine which EvolutionUpgrade events are eligible, but can never bypass lifeforce minima, eco FLOPs limits, DECAY safety, SCALE per-interval caps, or explicit DemonstratedConsentShard requirements.
