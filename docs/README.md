TITLE Evolution capacity must not be restricted, only shaped for safety

- BRAIN, WAVE, BLOOD, OXYGEN, NANO, SMART, EVOLVE, and TRAIT must never be used to deny a host’s right to evolve, learn, or heal.
- All guards (LifeforceBandSeries, DECAY, SCALE, Metabolic_Consent, KarmaAura, TRAIT) are safety-shaping mechanisms on *rate* and *per-step magnitude*, not permanent ceilings on capability.
- No shard, profile, or governance policy may introduce hard caps on total EVOLVE, total TRAIT count, or lifetime evolution domains; they may only require:
  - Biophysical safety (lifeforce floors, eco ceilings).
  - Verified self-consent and provenance.
  - Micro-step sizing when risk is high.
- Any host may always continue to evolve in new domains once safety conditions and consent are satisfied; denial can only be temporary, never structural or status-based.
